## MERN-APP

`banana`

### TO - DO App

- Full stack application
- We want to deploy it as one app on heroku in future
- Need to take care of the Structure of The Application:


  Our Plan is to have our server inside the main MERN-APP folder and client as sub folder inside the MERN-APP folder.
  We need to send the static files when user is accessing our app( because react-build will create a build folder that will contain all of our work as static)


## Functionalities of our App

## Frontend

- Registration with email and password.
- Sign-in
- React-router-dom
- State Management / Context Api
- axios / fetch

## Backend

- Basic express server
- Mongoose Connection
- Routes
- Controllers
- Models
- Hashing
- Authentication / Token creation after verifying email and password
- Authorization / Token verification
- Database (Mongodb)
